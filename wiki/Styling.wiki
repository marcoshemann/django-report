= Introduction =

Since pisa only support a subset of the CSS specification, styling your PDF to match the style of its HTML output is kinda tricky.

== Known limitation ==

=== Resources ===

You'll soon find out that parsing HTML to generate a PDF is somewhat ressource intensive. I can't figure any workaround for this right now.

=== Floats ===

Don't try it, just use a good old table.

=== Page count ===

There's no way to get a total page count. I found some hacky and unreliable methods to achieve it, but I don't suggest it.

== Tables ==

Getting the padding right within table cells (td/th) is a PITA.

Also, when printhing tables, they won't ever take the full (printable) width of the page .. I can't figure why.
